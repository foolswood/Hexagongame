<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>Get the circular player marker into the finish ring.</p>
<object id="simple_maze" type="image/svg+xml" data="hexagons.svg" width="200" height="200"></object>
<h2>Movement rules</h2>
<p>The player marker may move through sides of the hexagon it is currently in that match its colour.<br>
The player marker changes colour to that of the hexagon which was just exited.</p>
<object id="movement_example" type="image/svg+xml" data="hexagons.svg" width="200" height="200"></object>
<p>In this example the player marker may move through the red sides, and will end up green after moving.</p>
e.g.
<object id="movement_solution" type="image/svg+xml" data="hexagons.svg" width="100" height="100"></object>
or
<object id="movement_solution2" type="image/svg+xml" data="hexagons.svg" width="100" height="100"></object>
<p>A white player marker may move through sides of any colour and any marker colour may move through a white side.</p>

<h2>Menus and navigation</h2>
<p>Hexagons with small circles on them have mazes inside them, click on them to play those mazes (they can, and do, nest).</p>
<object id="menu_example" type="image/svg+xml" data="hexagons.svg" width="200" height="200"></object>
<p>Colours that you completed the inner maze with will appear in the small circles, which can then be used to "colour in" that hexagon in the containing maze.<br>
Click the medium white circle to play the current colouring of the menu maze. Click the yellow up arrow to go to out a maze nesting level.</p>
<p>If you make a mistake or get stuck in a maze click on the player marker to restart the current maze.<br>
If you are already at the start of a maze clicking on the player marker will return you to the menu.</p>
<h2>Shard collect mode</h2>
<p>In some mazes the player marker is "sharded" and must be reassembled. When moving in shard mode the colour of the shards are linked.</p>
<object id="shard_example" type="image/svg+xml" data="hexagons.svg" width="200" height="200"></object>
<p>When 2 shards move together from different coloured hexagons the resulting player colour will be white.</p>
