<h1>Chromagon - Instructions</h1>
<a id="std"><h2>Goal</h2></a>
<p>Get your circular player marker into the finish ring.</p>
<object id="simple_maze" type="image/svg+xml" data="hexagons.svg"></object>
<h3>Movement rules</h3>
<p>You may move through sides of the hexagon you are in that match your current colour.<br>
After moving you become the colour of the hexagon which you moved from.</p>
<div class="wrap">
    <div>
        <object id="movement_example" type="image/svg+xml" data="hexagons.svg"></object>
        &rarr;
    </div>
    <div>
        <object id="movement_solution" type="image/svg+xml" data="hexagons.svg"></object>
        &nbsp;/&nbsp;
        <object id="movement_solution2" type="image/svg+xml" data="hexagons.svg"></object>
    </div>
</div>
<p>In this example you can move through the red sides, and will end up green after moving.</p>
<p>White is a special colour and allows you through sides of any colour. Similarly you can pass through a white side in any colour.</p>
<p>If you make a mistake or get stuck click on the player marker to restart the current maze.</p>

<a id="menu"><h2>Menus and navigation</h2></a>
<p>Hexagons with small circles on them (like the one on the left below) have mazes inside them, click on them to play those mazes.</p>
<object id="menu_example" type="image/svg+xml" data="hexagons.svg"></object>
<p>Colours that you complete the inner maze with will appear in the small circles, which can be clicked to "colour in" that hexagon in the outer maze.</p>
<p>In this example the inner maze has 2 possible colours it can be solved in, hence the 2 small circles, but it has only been completed in one (green).</p>
<p>Once you have coloured the maze in you can click the medium sized white circle to play the menu maze with whatever colours you chose. The yellow up arrow takes you out a maze nesting level.</p>
<p>If you are already at the start of a maze clicking on the player marker will take you up to the menu maze.</p>

<a id="shard"><h2>Shard collect mode</h2></a>
<p>In some mazes the player marker is "sharded" and must be reassembled. The colours of the shards are linked.</p>
<object id="shard_example" type="image/svg+xml" data="hexagons.svg"></object>
<p>When shards move together from different coloured hexagons the resulting player colour is white.</p>

<a id="multiplayer"><h2>Multiplayer mode</h2></a>
<p>Players take it in turns making moves on a randomly generated 2 shard maze. The player that joins the shards is the winner.</p>
<p>It is also possible to win by being the first player to correctly identify that the shards can never join, however an incorrect guess eliminates that player for the rest of the round.</p>
<p>When it is your turn to move to make an impossible claim click the player marker as you would if you wanted to reset a single player maze. When it is another players turn click anywhere to make an impossible claim.</p>
